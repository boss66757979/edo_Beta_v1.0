Looking beyond the 10-year period， the botanists estimate that some 3，000 native plant species may become extinct in the foreseeable future—more than 10 percent of the approximately 25，000 species of plants in the United States .
The annual migrations of wildfowl and many other animals certainly cannot be regarded as a form of exploration， because such movements are actually only shifts from one habitat to another for the purpose of avoiding seasonal climatic variations .
Proponents of G-M foods argue using biotechnology in the production of food products has many benefits： it speeds up the process of breeding plants and animals with desired characteristics; can be used to introduce traits that a product wouldn‘t traditionally have; can improve the nutritional value of products; and can produce cheaper and more environmentallyfriendly fertilizers .
What makes this debate unique is that every meal we eat is at its very core . And that fact means one thing： it‘s an issue to be discussed not only around policy tables， but dinner tables .
“Contact us before writing your application”or“Make use of our long experience in preparing your curriculum vitae or job history” is how it is usually expressed .
There is no doubt， however， that it is the increasing number of applicants with university education at all points in the process of engaging staff that has led to the greater importance of the curriculum vitae .
Other goals of the interview are： to answer questions successfully， obtain any additional information needed to make a decision， accent your special strengths， establish a positive relationship， show confidence， and to sell yourself .
Based on these goals， place yourself in the role of the interviewer and develop anticipated questions and answers to three categories： company data， personal data， and specific job data .
Since the interview will center on you， proper self-management process is divided into four stages： the before stage， the greeting stage， the consultation stage， and the departure stage .
The before stage includes writing a confirmation letter， concentrating on appearance and nonverbal communication， developing your portfolio， anticipating questions with positive responses， and arriving early .
The greeting stage includes greeting everyone courteously， using waiting-room smarts， using your time wisely， and applying proper protocol when meeting the interviewer .
The consultation stage includes responsiveness and enthusiasm， knowing when to interject key points， showing sincerity， highlighting your strengths， and listening intently .
If the company doesn‘t respond in two weeks， call back or write a follow-up letter . You may get turned down . If so， try to find out why as a means of self-improvement .
I have sought it， next， because it relieves loneliness—that terrible loneliness in which one‘s shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss .
Non-traditional students， overwhelmingly female， began to study on a part-time basis， the numbers of women going to graduate school increased， and women sought entry to the non-traditional position of university faculty member .
This decline occurred in both coeducational and women‘s colleges where women faculty declined from 72% in 1940 to 50% in 1955 and dropped to a low of 45% in 1978.
More than one-third of employers in a new survey say they would probably cut off health benefits to their workers if Congress passes a law allowing patients to sue managed care plans for malpractice .
The employers apparently fear the legislation could open the door to the same kinds of suits against them . Companies are already struggling to contain rising health costs and deal with workers who complain that managed care blocks their access to care .
Although companies have relied on health maintenance organizations and other types of managed care firms to control costs through most of the 1990s， the Hewitt survey showed employers have serious concerns about the health plans .
Whatever you decide to do in the way of part-time and vacation work while you‘re at university，make sure that you take the following issues into consideration before committing yourself

In many states this year， budget requests by state universities have had to be scaled back or frozen， while tuition， the share of the cost borne by the students themselves， has gone up—in some cases faster than the rate of inflation .
So it was against this backdrop that members of the National Governors Association came together in this New England city this past week to discuss issues of common concern， one being higher education .
And the focus of their talks about colleges centered not on how money could be more effectively directed， but how to get greater productivity out of a system that many feel has become highly inefficient and resistive to change .
As a result， the governors will embark on a three-year study of higher education systems and how to make state colleges and universities better able to meet the challenges o a global economy in the 21st century .
With tuition rising faster than the rate of inflation and students taking longer and longer to finish college， one of these days the public is going to say，‘Enough !’ Pennsylvania Republican Gov . Tom Ridge said .
Ridge and his fellow governors came away from the meetings resolute in the belief that higher education needs a fresh look and possibly a major boost in productivity to meet demands of new technologies and a changing work force .
Several governors noted that establishment of clearer standards， greater efficiencies in providing services， and more student competency testing might be needed， in addition to curriculum inspection .
Like our political society， the university is under severe attack today and perhaps for the same reason; namely， that we have accomplished much of what we have set out to do in this generation， that we have done so imperfectly， and while we have been doing so， we have said a lot of things that simply are not true .
The university should use one-fourth of a student‘s time in his undergraduate years and organize it into courses which might be called history， and literature and philosophy， and anything else appropriate and organize these around primary problems .
On the other hand， there could be very serious consequences if this knowledge were used intentionally to produce superior and subordinate classes， each genetically prepared to carry out a predetermined mission .
After all， the purpose of education is not only to impart knowledge but to teach students to use the knowledge that they either have or will find， to teach them to ask and seek answers for important questions .
Many people expect this to change fundamentally the nature of television programming and viewing， from a broadcast medium (dominated by big networks like Britain‘s BBC and ITV and the big US networks， showing a mixture of programme types with something for everyone) to a“narrowcast” medium more like today’s magazines and radio .
The argument is that， as with gardening magazines today， such a channel could generate revenue both from subscriptions (since it would be tailored to that target audience) and from advertising (not just for gardening products， but also for other products and services such as cruise holidays and financial services aimed at the same target market)。
In the five years I‘ve worked here， we’ve gone to off-campus parties to write about underage drinking at our local college， exposed corruption in a local economic development group， and traced an embezzlers criminal past all the way to Alaska . I‘ve never seen our paper back down from a story .
Recently， when a young boy was shot to death， I had to repeatedly leave the scene to update my editor from a pay phone， while the reporter from a competing paper used his cell phone to chat with his office from the doorstep of the victim‘s house .
They lose daily contact with Nature， their idea of Nature is rather vague and non-experiential， so they think that they are independent of and above Nature， or even can live without Nature .
Thinking in terms of public experiences， we find that joyous experiences are a means; when thinking subjectively， or in terms of ones own sense experiences， we find that joyous experiences are an end .
So we should view joyous experiences and life sustenance in this way： Lifeis a carrier of senses and values， but not all sorts of senses and values are permitted， pursuance of forbidden ones will lead to the threat or even discontinuance of life as an individual and as a whole
Competition， formerly between individual firms， is now mainly between nations， and is therefore conducted by methods quite different from those formulated by the classical economists .(3)
We may say， therefore， speaking very generally， that men have used the increased productivity which they owe to science for three chief purposes in succession： first， to increase the population; then， to raise the standard of comfort; and， finally， to provide more energy to war .
Web browsers ! Interactive software ! There’s a lot of new technology talk going on in public relations these days， and its coming from a variety of sources .
The foundations of good public relations remain the same： anticipating and meeting the needs of clients and the media， and providing informed and useful counsel .
The delivery system is part of the message and contributes to the overall image， so the practitioner should consider how that system affects the client， the product， and the audiences .
In the last presidential election， more than one candidate had problems with their personal web-pages because webmasters were not kept up to date on changes in campaign strategy and messages .
They believe that those regulations， which exclude most poor husband and wife families from Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) assistance grants， contribute to the problem of family dissolution .
The third type is the unhappily married couple， who remain together out of a sense of economic responsibility for their children， because of the high costs of separation， or because of the consumption benefits of marriage .
Much of the variation in marital stability across income classes can be explained by the variation in costs of dissolution imposed by society， such as division of property， and child support .
To the extent that welfare is a form of governmentsubsidized AFDC payments， it reduces the costs of separation and guarantees a minimal standard of living for wife and children .
So welfare opportunities are a significant determinant of family instability in poor neighborhoods , but this is not the result of AFDC regulations that exclude most intact families from coverage .
Rather , welfarerelated instability occurs because public assistance lowers both the benefits of marriage and the costs of its breach by providing a system of governmentsubsidized payments .
The warning signs can be difficult enough to recognize; but the problem of identifying major depression in teens is further complicated by the fact that even these ambiguous signs are not always present .
They are using what we know as signs , to communicate with each other about some situation that is present at that moment: gathering the group , alarm , hunting , mating .
Is it possible to imagine something as highly refined and subtle as the cave paintings of 15,000 years ago without language to enable manipulation and transference of ideas ?
Possession of language is a defining mark of our humanity , and it has been faithfully accompanying us ever since our branch first emerged as a distinct species .
In Prague , when Tomas and Tereza brought a new chair or moved a flower pot , Karenin would look on in displeasure . It disturbed his sense of time . Nonetheless , he soon managed to reestablish the old order and old rituals in the Zurich flat .
In periods of despair , she would remind herself she had to hold on because of him , because he was weaker than she , weaker perhaps even than Dubcek and their abandoned homeland .
When she said that Tomas wasn’t there and she didn’t know when he’d be back , the woman on the other end of the line started laughing and , without saying good-bye , hung up .
It was then that she realized she had lost the last bit of strength she had had at home; she was absolutely incapable of tolerating this absolutely insignificant incident . 
Others were less intentional , such as his habit of attending baseball and football games and watching the game from the stands with all the other fans , presenting himself as a man of the people , rather than viewing from a luxury box with the team owner .
Unlike his hero Theodore Roosevelt , who helped create the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) while in office , Nixon repeatedly backed away from opportunities to use the prestige of his office to have an influence in the world of sport , such as preventing the relocation of the Washington Senators baseball team to the Dallas Ft . Worth area . He did , however , attempt to use sport as venue to shape cultural values .
While the percentage of the world’s population living on less than $1 per day has fallen from 28.3% to 24.0% between 1987 and 1998, population growth (815million) has kept the absolute number of poor steady at some 1.2 billion .
Nor do World Bank projections lend undivided hope for the future . Under the “business as usual" scenario , the number of poor on the $1 per day scale will not change during the projection period up to 2008.
However , should policy measures be taken to boost economic growth and make the growth process more inclusive to the poor , the World Bank reckons that 500 million people could be brought out of extreme poverty by 2008.
Indeed , such concerns have been vented with increasing frustration , including at the Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Seattle last year , and more recently at the joint spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank .
One problem facing governments in povertystricken countries , civil society , and international organizations is that poverty is a multidimensional problem with no simple solution — not least because of its sheer scale .
The causes and expressions of poverty are not the same everywhere , although some common terms can often be found , including a lack of access to education , basic health care , and unequal distribution of productive assets (land , livestock , credits , etc .).
The existence of both racial and sexual discrimination in employment is well documented , and policy makers and responsible employers are particularly sensitive to the plight of the black female employee on the theory that she is doubly the victim of discrimination .
Moreover , State distribution of residence is important because blacks are overrepresented in the South , where wage rates are typically lower than elsewhere and where racial differentials in income are greater .
Recently , there have been some imaginative attempts to make polycrystalline and ribbon silicon which are lower in cost than high-quality single crystals; but to date the efficiencies of these apparently lower-cost materials have been unacceptably small .
Although many scientists were aware of the very low cost of amorphous solar cells , they felt that they could never be manufactured with the efficiencies necessary to contribute significantly to the demand for electric power .
Already , solar cells with efficiencies well above 6 percent have been developed using amorphous materials , and further research will doubtlessly find even less costly amorphous materials with higher efficiencies .
This imaginary task gives some idea of the challenge facing biologists in the United States and elsewhere as they embark on a monumental project: deciphering all the coded information in the human genome , all the genes in a human cell .
They predict that a complete understanding of the human genetic code would provide untold benefits for humanity , for example , those abilities to diagnose , cure , and eventually prevent many diseases caused by faulty genes .
Not only has the Government refused to consult with the people of Australia on this issue of prohibition of free communication between individuals , they have also refused to consult with industry , and ignored all technical evidence and reports on the issues .
And not only is it technically impossible to censor current content of the Internet , but the Internet is set to explode exponentially in the indefinite future , with there being literally millions of changes and additions to web content on a daily basis .
In order to make economic development agreements more attractive to investors , some developing countries have attempted to strengthen the security of such agreements , specifying that the agreements will be governed by “general principles of law recognized by civilized nations"—a set of legal principles or rules shared by the world’s major legal systems .
Moreover , even in the case of administrative contracts , French law requires that in the event that the government modifies the terms of the contract on its own side , it must compensate the contractor for any increased burden resulting from the government’s action .
In both the United States and the United Kingdom , government contracts are governed by the ordinary law of contracts , with the result that the government can reserve the power to modify or terminate a contract on its own side only by writing such power into the contract .
